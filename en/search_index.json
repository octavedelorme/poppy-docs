The source can be found and modified on GitHub.\nIn the first chapter, we will give you a simple but exhaustive overview of what you can do within this project, so you can quickly focus on the following chapters that cover what you are really interested in. While some advanced chapters may require a good understanding of mechanics, electronics or computer sciences, the Getting Started section is intended to be easily accessible by all readers.\nVersion\nThis is the version 1.0 of the Poppy documentation, updated at Thu Jan 26 2017 21:07:10 GMT+0000 (UTC).\nIt contains the documentation for:\n\nPoppy Humanoid hardware version 1.0.1\nPoppy Torso hardware version 1.0.1\nPoppy ErgoJr hardware version beta 6\npoppy_humanoid library version 1.1.1\npoppy_torso library version 1.1.5\npoppy_ergo_jr library version 1.4.0\npoppy.creatures library version 1.7.1\npypot library version 2.10.0\n\n"},"getting-started/":{"url":"getting-started/","title":"Getting started","keywords":"","body":"Getting Started\n\nPoppy Project is an open-source platform for the creation, use and sharing of interactive 3D printed robots. It gathers an interdisciplinary community of beginners and experts, scientists, educators, developers and artists. They all share a vision: robots are powerful tools to learn and be creative and collaborate to improve the project. They develop new robotic behaviors, create pedagogical contents, design artistic performances, improve the software or even create new robots.\nThe Poppy community develops robotic creations that are easy to build, customize, and deploy. We promote open-source by sharing hardware, software. A web platform is associated enabling the community to share experiences and to contribute to its improvement.\nTo ease these exchanges two supports are available:\n\nThe poppy-project forum for help, discussions and sharing ideas.\nGitHub to submit your contributions.\n\nAll sources of the Poppy Project (software and hardware) are available on GitHub.\nThe Poppy project has been originally designed at Inria Flowers.\nThe Poppy creatures\nPoppy creatures are open-source robots, available for download and modification (Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike for the hardware and GPLv3 for the software). They were designed with the same principles in mind.\nAll Poppy creatures:\n\nare made from pieces of printable 3D and Dynamixel motors,\nuse an embedded board for control (a Raspberry Pi 2 or Odroid for older versions),\nare based on a Python library, pypot, allowing to control Dynamixel servomotors in an easy way,\nhave a simulated version available (based on V-REP),\ncan be controlled using a visual programming language (Snap! a variation of Scratch) and a textual language Python. They are also programmable through a REST API, which enables the control with other programming language,\ncome with associated documentation, tutorials, examples, pedagogical activities.\n\nThey can be used as it is, or hacked to explore new shapes, add sensors, etc...\nTo get your own Poppy robot, you can either:\n\nGet all the parts yourself by following the bill of materials (see below).\nBuy a full Poppy robotic kit from our official retailer.\n\nPoppy Ergo Jr\nThe Poppy Ergo Jr robot is a small and low cost 6-degrees-of-freedom robot arm. It is made of 6 cheap motors (XL-320 Dynamixel servos) with simple 3D-printed parts.\n\nThe 3D parts were made so they can be easily printed on a basic 3D printer. The motors are only 20€ each. Its electronic card access is simple. It makes it easy to connect extra sensors and is well suited for pedagogical purposes.\nYou can choose among three tools at the end of its arm:\n\nA lamp.\nA gripper.\nA pen holder.\n\nThe rivets used make it easy and quick to change the tools. You can adapt it depending on the type of activities you are doing.\n\nThe Ergo Poppy Jr is ideal to start manipulating robots and learn robotic without difficulties. It is simple to assemble, easy to control and low price.\nYou can get all the parts yourself following the bill of materials (BOM) and print the 3D parts available in the STL format.\nFor more information, check the assembly guide of the Ergo Jr.\nPoppy Humanoid\nIt is a 25-degrees of freedom humanoid robot with a fully actuated vertebral column. It is used for education, research (walk, human-robot interaction) or art (dance, performances). From a single arm to the complete humanoid, this platform is actively used in labs, engineering schools, FabLabs, and artistic projects.\nYou can get all the parts yourself following the bill of materials (BOM) and print the 3D parts available as STL, STEP and Solidworks 2014 format.\n\nPoppy Torso\nIt is the upper part of Poppy Humanoid (13 degrees of freedom). Poppy Torso is thus more affordable than the complete Poppy Humanoid. It makes it a more suitable solution for educational, associative and makers contexts. Poppy Torso can be a good medium to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM).\nYou can get all the parts yourself following the bill of material. The 3D models for the parts are the same as Poppy Humanoid, without the legs and with an extra suction cup support.\n\nOther interesting Poppy Creatures\nA key aspect of the Poppy Project is to stimulate creativity and experimentation around robotics. We try to provide all the tools needed to design new robots based on the same technological bricks. Some new creatures are in development within the community. Some of them are presented in the section below.\nPoppy right arm (work in progress)\nPoppy right arm is a Poppy creature based on a right arm of Poppy Humanoid, with 3 additional XL-320 motors at the end to improve the reach and agility of the arm. It used the same gripper tool used in the Ergo Jr, designed to grab simple objects.\n\nThe project was realized during an internship at Inria Flowers by Joel Ortiz Sosa. Find more info and the sources in the repository.\nSmall and low-cost humanoids\nHeol\nHeol - meaning \"sun\" in Breton - is a 34cm tall humanoid robot made by the association Heol robotics. 23 motors compose it, all other parts are 3D printed. It also uses the pypot library for its movements.\nHeol's purpose is to put a smile on ill children's faces. It can be an educational tool by becoming a learning support materials for programming and mechanical design.\nIts participation in the RoboCup (World Cup football for robot) is also envisaged.\n\nPoppyrate\nIt a robot based on Poppy Humnaoid. It aims at developing a more affordable version thanks to its smaller size and the use of cheaper motors. The size reduction also makes it easier to print the parts on a standard 3D-printer. Goals also involved making it as mobile and customisable as possible while maintaining compability with Poppy software.\nPoppyrate will be sold as a kit (with and without the 3D parts) It has been designed by the socity ZeCloud.\n\nFor more information, check their Website - Twitter - Facebook!\n"},"getting-started/build.html":{"url":"getting-started/build.html","title":"Build a robot","keywords":"","body":"Build the robot\n\nDepending on the Poppy robots you are planning to use, the assembly time, required skills, tools and difficulty may vary a lot. Building an Ergo Jr should take about one hour and no specific tool is needed while assembling an entire Poppy Humanoid may take a few days and quite a lot of screws!\nThis section intends to give you hints and a glimpse of some critical points so you aware of them before digging into the construction. We will also point to each dedicated chapter where you will find the resources and detailed step by step assembly procedure for each robot.\nAssembling an Ergo Jr\n\nNote You can find a full assembly documentation in the chapter step by step assembly of an Ergo Jr.\n\n\n\nThe Ergo Jr robot was designed to be a simple little robot, cheap and easy to use. The 3D parts were made so they can be easily printed on a basic 3D printer and the motors (6 XL-320 Dynamixel servos) are only 20$ each.\nThe Ergo Jr is very easy to build and its end effector can be easily changed - you can choose among several tools: a lamp, a gripper, a pen holder...\nThanks to OLLO rivets the robot is very simple to assemble. These rivets can be removed and added very quickly with the OLLO tool. It should not take more than one hour to entirely built it, which allows great design freedom.\n\nExcept from checking the motor orientation, there is not really any pitfall. If you are familiar with Lego bricks, you should be able to assemble an Ergo Jr without much problem! Rivets were made to be as easy to assemble than to disassemble, so in case of problem you can just start over!\nAlso make sure, to configure your motors before assembling the robot as it is harder to do after!\nAssembling a Torso or a Humanoid\n\nNote You can find a full assembly documentation in the chapter step by step assembly of a Poppy Humanoid.\n\n\nBuilding a Poppy Torso or a Humanoid is more complex than a Ergo Jr but it is not really more complicated than building a Meccano or some Swedish furniture. It mainly consists on those few steps:\n\n\nassemble the horn on each motors: you will have to be really cautious about the motor zero position!\nconfigure the motors so they match the poppy configuration\nuse a lot of screws to connect all 3D printed parts to the motors\ndo a bit of electronic for the embedded board inside the head: this can be a bit tricky if you are not familiar with electronics.\n\nPatience and precision are your allies, but in case of errors do not panic: Poppy is a robot intended to be assembled and disassembled. If you pay attention to the few warnings bellows, and with a few trials and errors you will have a working Poppy Torso or Poppy Humanoid:\nWarning 1: The Poppy humanoid and torso robots are built using mainly MX-28 and MX-64 Dynamixel servomotors. They are pretty powerful and may be harmful to your fingers or materials. So be very careful and put the robot in a free space while testing it!\nWarning 2: Put the dot on the horn at the same point than the dot on the servo axis.\n\nWarning 3: Adjusts the three dots of the motors with the three dots of the structural part.\n\nWarning 4: Use thread locker to prevent vibrations from untying the screws. However, dipping the extremity of the screw on the thread locker is enough (a drop for each screw hole is too much). Otherwise disassembling your robot can be very hard!\n\nStep by step guide for the asssembly :\n\nGuide for the Humanoid\nGuide for the Torso\n\n"},"getting-started/connect.html":{"url":"getting-started/connect.html","title":"Connect to the robot","keywords":"","body":"Start and connect the robot\nIn this section, we will describe how to start your robot and give an overview of the possibilities to access it.\nSetup the software\nPoppy creatures come with an embedded board which job is to control motors and access the sensors. For simplicity purpose, this computer can be remotely access through a web interface. It makes it easy to control the robot from your own computer or tablet without having to download/install anything.\nThere are two ways to setup the board for your Poppy robot:\n\nthe easy way: use a pre-made ISO image of the Poppy operating system and write it to an the SD-card\nthe hard way for advanced users: install everything from scratch\n\n\nNote If you are planning to use a simulated robot, you must install the software on your personal computer. Follow the instructions for setting up the simulation.\n\nEasy and recommended way: use the Poppy SD-card\nThe easiest and quickest way - by far - is to use an already made system image for a SD-card. ISO images come with everything pre-installed for your Poppy robot. It is also a good way to ensure that you are using exactly the same software as we are. Thus, you will avoid most problems.\n\nNote Poppy robotic kits come with a ready to use SD-card. So, you do not have anything special to do.\n\nThe images can be found in the release of each creatures:\n\nfor the Poppy ErgoJr\nfor the Poppy Torso\nfor the Poppy Humanoid\n\nThey can be written to a SD-card (at least 8 Go) by using classical utility tools.\nOnce the SD-card is ready, just insert it into the board. Then when you switch on your robot it should automatically start and you should be able to connect to its web interface.\n\nInfo More details can be found in the startup section.\n\nAdvanced way: DIY, install everything from scratch\nThe advanced way mainly consists in installing everything needed from scratch. This follows the same procedure as we use to generate the image for SD-cards. We mention this possibilty here as it can be useful if:\n\nYou are working with a simulated robot and thus have to manually install all the required software on your computer, this procedure could be a good place to see how this can be done on a Raspberry-Pi and adapted to another computer,\nyou want to customize the environment,\nor simply if you like to understand how it works.\n\n\nCaution We try to keep this installation procedure as generic as possible. Yet, some details may vary depending on your operating system or your computer. Moreover, the installation from scratch required some good knowledge of how to install and setup a python environment.\n\nDepending on what you want to do all steps are not necessary required. In particular, if you want to control a simulated robot, you may just want to install the python libraries for Poppy.\n\nInfo More details can be found in the Installation for advanced users section.\n\nSetup the network\nOnce your Poppy is assembled and its software is ready, the next step is to connect it to a network. The goal is to let you remotely access the robot from your computer or smartphone/tablet, control and program it.\nThey are two main ways to connect your robot to your computer/tablet/smartphone:\n\nConnect both the robot and the computer to the same network (e.g. the box of your home or the school network).\nDirectly connect your robot to your computer using an ethernet cable.\n\n\nCaution While directly plugging the robot to a computer works for most users. It seems that in some strange cases it refuses to work.\n\nTo find the address of your robot on the network, we use the standard Zeroconf protocol. It allows you to use the robot hostname: \"poppy.local\" as its address. This should works without any configuration under Mac OS and GNU/Linux. But it required to install Bonjour Print Services on Windows.\nIf you prefer, you can use the IP address assigned to your robot instead. If you are not administrator of your network this can be a tricky information to find. In this case the first procedure should be preferred.\nTo check that everything is setup correctly, you can go to the following url using your favorite web browser: http://poppy.local/. You can replace poppy.local by the IP address of your robot (something similar as http://192.168.0.42).\n\nCaution If you are not familiar with network configuration or have no idea what the previous paragraph poorly tried to explain, you should see with the IT network engineer, how this can be done.\n\nUse the web interface\nThe web interface is the central point to control, program and configure your robot. It can be used to:\n\nMonitor and Control the robot\nProgram it in Snap!\nProgram it in Python\nConfigure the robot (change its name, enable/disable the camera, update)\nReset and shutdown the robot\n\nTo access this interface, you simply have to go to the URL using your favorite web browser:\n\nhttp://poppy.local (if you changed the name of your robot, simply replace poppy by its new name)\nor using directly its IP address\n\nYou should see something like:\n\nThe buttons can be used to navigate to the different features. For instance, if you click on the Monitor and Control, you will access the monitor web app:\n\nThis let you turn on/off the motors of your robot, monitor them, and start/stop behaviors.\nThe What happened button is where you should look for more information is something goes wrong. Here is a screenshot of what you should see if everything goes well:\n\n"},"getting-started/program-the-robot.html":{"url":"getting-started/program-the-robot.html","title":"Program the robot","keywords":"","body":"Program the robot\nPoppy robots are designed to be easily programmed. They are three main options presented here:\n\nusing Snap!, a variant of Scratch the visual programming language,\nusing Python and leveraging the power of the whole API,\nthrough the  REST API which let you  interface Poppy robots with other devices or any programming language.\n\n\nInfo As for the rest of the project, all our libraries are open source and available on GitHub.\n\n\nUsing Snap!\n\nSnap! is a visual programming language - a variant of the very famous Scratch language. It is a block based drag-and-drop programming language that allows for a thorough introduction of IT. It runs in your browser as it is implemented in JavaScript. You do not need to install anything to start using it. It is open sourced and actively maintained.\n\nWe developed a set of custom blocks for Poppy robots that let you send motor commands and read values from the sensors of your robot. This let you to directly jump into controlling and programming your without any syntax/compilation issue. Thanks to Snap! live interaction loop you simply have to click on a block to send its associated command to the robot. Snap! also naturally scales to more complex projects.\nA dedicated chapter will guide you in what you can do with Snap! and Poppy robots.\nUsing Python\n\nPoppy libraries have been written in Python, to allow for fast development and extensibility and to benefit from all existing scientific libraries. Python is also a well-known language and widely used in education or artistic fields. By programming Poppy in Python, you will have access from the very low-level API to the higher levels.\nThe API has been designed to allow for very fast prototyping. Creating a robot and starting to move motors should not take more than a few lines:\nfrom poppy.creatures import PoppyErgoJr\n\njr = PoppyErgoJr()\njr.m3.goal_position = 30\n\n\nWe are also big fan of the Jupyter Project and notebooks. Notebooks are documents which contain both Python code and rich text elements like equations, pictures, videos. They can be edited from the Jupyter Web interface which allow users to program Poppy robots directly from a website hosted on the robot computer. We think that this is a powerful tool permitting the creation and sharing of live code, results visualizations and explanatory text combined in a single document.\n  \nMost of the tutorials, experiments or pedagogical activities that we and the community develop are available as notebooks.\n\n\nInfo An updated gallery of notebooks can be found here. Contribtions welcomed!\n\nThrough the REST API\nOn top of the Snap! and Python options, we wanted to provide another way of accessing and controlling your robot from any device or language. Poppy robots are providing a REST API. The most important features of the robot can be access through HTTP GET/POST requests.\nFrom a more practical point of view, this allows you to:\n\nWrite bridges to control Poppy robot in any language (awesome contributors have already written Matlab and Ruby wrappers).\nDesign web apps connected to your robot, such as the monitor interface (also a contribution!).\nMake your robot interact with other connected devices such as a smartphone, intelligent sensors, or even your twitter account...\n\n\nCaution The REST API is still a work in progress, will change and is clearly ill documented! For more information you can have a look here our on the forum. A well designed, stable and well documented REST API is expected for the next major software release.\n\n"},"getting-started/visualize.html":{"url":"getting-started/visualize.html","title":"Visualize","keywords":"","body":"Visualize the robot in a simulator\nSimulated Poppy Creatures\nSimulated versions of all Poppy robots (Humanoid, Torso, and Ergo Jr) are available.\nConnection with two main \"simulators\" were developed:\n\nusing V-REP: a virtual robot experimentation platform\nusing a 3D web viewer: lighter but without physics support\n\n\nCaution At the moment, only the Poppy Ergo Jr can be used in the web visualizer. If you want to simulate other creatures, you should use V-REP. Support for the other robots is planned but not expected in the near future.\n\nWe think simulation can be a powerful tool. It allows the development and test of programs without the need of having a real robot. This is especially useful:\n\nTo discover and try the robot possibilities without having to spend real money.\nIn a context where multiple users share a robot. For instance in a classroom where each group can work using the simulator and validate their program on a real robot.\nTo design and run complex and time consuming experiments.\n\nWe try to make the switch from a simulated Poppy robot to the real one as transparent and as simple as possible. Most of the programming documentation is actually valid for both simulated and real robots. The chapter From simulation to real robot will guide you in the few steps to transform your program running in simulation to one working with a real robot.\n\nCaution If you want to use Poppy robots using a simulator you will have to install some of the poppy libraries locally on your computer.\n\nInstall the needed software\nWhile the physical robots come with libraries pre-installed, they are not integrated in the simulators. Thus, you need to install them on your computer. More details of what you will have to do is given in the section below. You will also not have access to the robot web interface. You will have to manually launch the different services to start programming your robot (the Jupyter server for Python notebooks, or the Snap! server).\n\nInfo We are hoping to have a one-click app for Windows/Mac/Linux with everything setup at some point. Yet, this is not expected to be available in the near future.\n\nTo start controlling a simulated Poppy robots, either using V-REP or the web visualizer, you will need:\n\nTo have a working Python, we strongly recommend to use the Anaconda Python distribution. It works with any version >=2.7 or >=3.4. Prefer Python 2.7 if you can, as it is the version we used.\nTo install the Poppy libraries: pypot and the library corresponding to your creature (e.g. poppy-ergo-jr).\n\n\nNote Details about those steps can be found in section Install everything locally for using a simulator.\n\nUsing V-REP\nV-REP is a well known and powerful robot simulator. It is widely used for research and educational purposes. Moreover, it is available for free under an educational license. It can be download from this website (works under Mac OS, Windows and GNU/Linux).\n\nCaution It is important to note that as V-REP is simulating the whole physics and rendering of the robot, it may be slow if you do not have a powerful computer (especially the GPU card).\n\n\nAll main Poppy robots are available in V-REP:\n\nPoppy Humanoid\nPoppy Torso\nPoppy Ergo Jr\n\nV-REP can be used to learn how to control motors, get information from sensors but also to interact with the simulated environment. It can be controlled using Python, Snap! or through the REST API. Here, are some examples of what the community has already been doing with it:\n\nA pedagogical activity to discover the different motor of your robot and how they can be controlled.\nA scientific experiment, where a Poppy Torso is learning how to push a cube on a table in front of it\n\n\n\nNote Even if we try, to reproduce the robot behaviour and functioning, some differences remain. In particular, if you make a robot walk in simulation that does not necessarily mean that it will walk in the real world (and vice-versa).\n\nUsing our web visualizer\nOur web visualizer - based on the Three.js library - will show you a 3D representation of a Poppy robot. For this, you will need to connect it to either a real robot (through the REST-API) or to a simple mockup robot running on your computer. You simply have to set the host variable from within the web interface to match the address of your robot. \n\n\nNote A mockup robot can be started via the poppy-services command. For instance: poppy-services --poppy-simu --snap poppy-ergo-jr\n\nAs for V-REP, you can control your Robot using Python, Snap!, or the REST API. Yet, there is no physics simulation so its lighter but you will not be able to interact with objects.\nHere is an example with Python:\n\n"},"getting-started/example-of-projects.html":{"url":"getting-started/example-of-projects.html","title":"Examples of projects","keywords":"","body":"Overview of projects developed by the community\nThe Poppy community gathers an interdisciplinary community of beginners and experts, scientists, educators, developers and artists. Various and interdisciplinary robotic creations have emerged. Some of them are illustrated below.\nSchool of Moon\nThe School of moon play has been created by the contemporary dance company Shonen lead by the choregrapher Eric Minh Cuong Castaing.\nThe stage is shared by children, two dancers (Gaëtan Brun Picard and Ana Pi), 3 Nao robots and two Poppy Humanoid robots. This play is a metaphor of the creation of a post-humanity in three acts: the Man, the Man and the machine, and the machine.\n\n\nThe representations are localized, meaning that the children dancing come from the local town. They also are specific sequences depending on the robots existing in the city. \nThe artistic challenges are:\n\nDirecting children on stage\nHaving interaction between humans and robots on stage\nHaving robots on stage\n\nThe creation was focused on 4 time periods: \n\n2 weeks of residence in September  2015 in CDC of Toulouse (France)\n2 weeks of residence in KLAP of Marseille (France) in December 2015\n4 weeks of residence in Ballet National de Marseille (France) in January 2016\n2 weeks of residence in Düsseldorf (Germany)\n\nCherry Project\n\nThe Cherry project is a community project to develop scenarios regarding breaking isolation of children at the hospital.\n This project uses Poppy robot as a companion for hospitalized children in primary school. Cherry can compensate a social rupture during hospitalization. It mediates between the child, his friends, his family and teachers and can talk to him or play some games.\n It also acts on a pedagogical level, to encourage the child to interact with the school, by offering quizzes and educational games.\n One last prospect is to assist the hospital staff in the therapeutic education. Indeed, sometimes a message is more acceptable by the child if it is issued by the robot rather than an adult dressed as a physician.\n \n \n \n\nMore information:\n\nThe facebook page\nThe twitter\nThe wordpress\nThe github (with a short wiki)\n\nConnect Poppy and Arduino thanks to Snap4Arduino\nGilles, teacher and maker at night, has developed many projects based on the Poppy Ergo Jr and Arduino. For connecting both worlds, it uses Snap4arduino. Then, it becomes really easy and elegant to make them communicate. You can simply mix Arduino with Poppy blocks and tadam you can control your robot with any Arduino based sensor. \n\n\n\nThen the only limitation is your creativity!

Meaning, that before assembling a new motor, you first configure it, then assemble to the rest of your robot. This will prevent you to swap motors. In the step-by-step assembly procedure, we will point out each time you need to configure a new motor. Furthermore, you will also be able to directly configure the motor from the assembly notebook interface.\nConfiguring motors one at a time\nAs explained above, all motors have the same ID by default. Only one motor at a time should be connected to the data bus when you configure them. Otherwise, it will not work as all motors connected will think that the order sent on the line is intended for them, they will all try to answer resulting in a big mess.\nYour electronic setup when configuring a motor should look like this:\n\nthe Raspberry Pi\nthe shield on top and the AC plugged\na wire from the shield to the motor you want to configure\na ethernet cable going from the Raspberry Pi to your computer or your router\n\n\nWeb interface (user friendly)\n\n\n \n\nCaution The web utility for configuring motors is still in the TODO stack.\n\nCommand-line utility\nRobots come with a command line utility poppy-configure ; to use it you need to open a terminal on your Raspberry Pi.\nYou can access to the Raspberry Pi directly from your computer. To do so, open the page http://poppy.local in a web browser. You see the Poppy home page. Click on the \"Jupyter — Python, Terminal\" link and select \"New Terminal\".\n\nOnce the terminal is open, copy and press enter to execute the commande bellow.\npoppy-configure ergo-jr m1\n\nYou have now configured the m1 motor of your robot.\nOnce configured and that you see the message indicating that everything went well, you can unplug the motor (you don't need to turn off the card). The configuration of the motor is stored in the motor internal memory.\n\nInfo Poppy Ergo Jr motors are named m1, m2, m3, m4, m5, m6. To configure the others motors, you have to change m1 by the name of the motor you want to configure in the command above.\n\n"},"assembly-guides/ergo-jr/mechanical-construction.html":{"url":"assembly-guides/ergo-jr/mechanical-construction.html","title":"Hardware construction","keywords":"","body":"Mechanical Assembly\nGeneral advices and warnings\n\n\nYou can assemble all the rivets before the construction. You have to put the edges of the first part in the second part holes. You will thus be able to remove them easily if needed.\n\n\n\nThere are two kinds of rivets. The grey ones and the others. Grey rivets are longer to be able to be inserted in the motor axis, at the opposite side of the horn.\n\n\n\nUse the OLLO Tool for putting and removing rivets easily.\n\n\n\nDo not forget to put wires between motors while building the robot! Each motor, except the last, must have two wires; one connected to the previous motor and the other to the next (no favourite side).\n\n\nAlways align the horn with the motor before assembling them! Otherwise your Poppy Ergo Jr will look all weird.\n\n\n\nEvery motor horns (black revolving circle) are facing the left side of the robot. It is a convention but it will define the orientation of your motors.\n\n\nStep-By-Step guide\nMotor configuration (for all steps)\nYou can configure your motors before, during or after the the mechanical assembly but it is highly advised to configure each motor one by one in the construction order :\n\nconfigure motor m1\nassemble the base and motor m1\nconfigure motor m2 \n...\n\n\nCaution To configure motors, you have to connect them separately one by one to the Raspberry Pi. If you try to configure a new motor wired to a previously configured motor, this will not work.\n\nPlease consult the motor configuration section for more informations.\nStep 1\nFirst, configure one XL-320 motor as \"m1\". \nMount the motor on the 3D printed base. \n\nTo do so, prepare 8 small rivets. put the first part in the second part without putting them in the motor. Then, place the motor in the base, with the horn facing up and near the more open side.\nUse the Ollo to grab a rivet between the first and the second part, then put the rivet in one the assembly holes. Once the rivet is in place, lock it by pushing the part 1 of the rivet in part 2.\nStep 2\nConfigure the second motor, its name is \"m2\", with the following command in a poppy terminal:\npoppy-configure ergo-jr m2\n\nMount the long_U part. Be careful wih the orientation of the U, the horn must be oriented in the left.\nMount the motor \"m2\" on top of the construction.\n\nStep 3\nConfigure a third motor: \"m3\".\nMount horn2horn and horn2side parts on motor \"m2\", and mount \"m3\" on top of the construction.\n\nStep 4\nConfigure the fourth motor: \"m4\".\nMount the short_U on it.\n\nMount motor \"m4\" and the assembled short_U on top of the previous assembly. The nose of the motor should be on the other side of the base.\n\nStep 5\nConfigure the fifth motor: \"m5\".\nMount horn2horn and horn2side parts on motor \"m4\", and mount \"m5\" on top of the construction.\n\nStep 6 - the tool of your choice\nConfigure the sixth motor: \"m6\".\nTo finish your Ergo Jr, you need to add a tool at its end. So first choose the tool you want depending on what you want to do.\n\nNote Tools they can be easily and quickly changed, so you can adapt it to the different activities.\n\nLampshade or pen holder\nMount horn2horn and horn2side parts on motor \"m5\", and mount \"m6\" on top of the construction.\n\nYou can mount the pen holder or the lampshade on the motor \"m6\".\n\nGripper\nMount the gripper-fixation between motors \"m5\" and \"m6\".\nMount gripper-fixed_part and gripper-rotative_part on motor \"m6\".\n\nStep 7 - electronics\nMount the support_camera part on the base. Fix the Raspberry Pi camera on it and move the camera flex cable between motor \"m1\" and the base.\n\nTo fix the flex cable of the camera on the Raspberry Pi:\n\nopen the camera connector by pulling on the tab \nmake sure that connectors on the flex cable are facing away of the ethernet port\npush the flex on the port, and push the plastic tab down\n\n\nMotors wires:\nIf it is not already done, you can plug every motors wires. Every motor has two connectors but there is no input or output: you just have to create a chain of motors. The first motor is linked to the pixl and the second motor; the last motor is linked only to the previous one, and every other motors are linked to the one above and ahead.\n\n\nInfo Connectors of the motor \"m1\" (in the base) are a bit hard to link, you can use the OLLO tool to help yourself.\n\n\nStep 8 - fix you ergo-jr to wood disk support\nMount you ergo-jr to the wood disk-support. \nMount the Raspberry Pi to the disk support, and use 4 x M2.5x6mm screw to fix it.\n\nDone\n\nGrab your favorite drink and relax.\n"},"assembly-guides/poppy-humanoid/":{"url":"assembly-guides/poppy-humanoid/","title":"Assemble the Poppy Humanoid","keywords":"","body":"Assembly guide for the Poppy Humanoid\n\n\nCaution The assembly guide for the humanoid has still not been merged on the new doc.

You can use its IP address (for example http://192.168.1.42) if you have a way to know it or its hostname like http://poppy.local. To find its IP address look at the zeroconf chapter. To use directly its hostname http://poppy.local you must have a Zeroconf software installed on your computer (aka \"Bonjour print services for Windows\" if you are running Windows).\nThe home page of your poppy creature should look like the snapshot below:\n\nClick on the \"Start Snap!\" link to open the Snap! interface at start the connection with the Poppy robot.\nPoppy special blocks are stored in the Examples. Go to \"file\" icon -> open -> Examples -> click on \"Poppy blocks\". It may take some time to load the blocks (~5-15 seconds), be patient.\nInterface and general ideas\nSaving in Snap!\nThere are three ways of saving a project in Snap!\nSave the project in your web browser\n\nWhen you are not logged in Snap! Cloud, the default behaviour of Snap! is to save your project in your browser.\nTechnically this uses the Local Storage which is a memory space in your web browser where websites can store offline data. This is very convenient because you have not to register or to see Snap! project files, but keep in mind that these projects are only visible in this specific web browser in this specific computer.\nSnap! Cloud\n\n« There is no Cloud, it's just someone else's computer ».\n\nInstead of saving your projects on your web browser, you can save them in Snap! servers in UC Berkeley, called \"cloud\". Moreover, this allows you to share your project with anyone, with a simple link.\nCreate an account on Snap! cloud\nClick on the cloud button -> \"signup...\".\n\nFill the required fields in the modal window for signing up.\n\nYou will soon receive a validation email with a random password.\nYou can now log in with your username and password.\n\nIf you use your personal computer, remember to check the \"stay signed in on this computer [...]\" checkbox.\n\nAfter logging in account, you are free to change your password: click on the cloud button -> \"Change Password\".\n\nShare your Snap! project\nThe big advantage of using Snap! Cloud is the ability to share a copy of your project with anyone.\nTo share a Snap! project, you first need to be logged in Snap! Cloud and having your current project saved (\"save\" or \"save as\"). Go to the \"open\" menu:\n\nIn the cloud section, select the project you want to share and click on \"Share\" button.\n\nHere is the trick step: to see the share link, you have to click on the \"Open\" button.\n\nAnd this will re-open your project with the public sharing URL.\n\nYou can copy and paste the URL and share it by the way you want to your friends or to the Poppy community with the forum forum.poppy-project.org.\nWhen you open a share project, the project is automatically opened in full screen on the sprite zone. To quit the full screen you have to click on the double arrow at the top of the snapshot below.\n\nExport/Import your Snap! project\nIf you have a limited access to internet and you want to share project with other people, the best way is to export it:\n\nA new tab in your web browser will be opened with an XML file like the picture below.\n\nThis file describe all your Snap! project in a a simple file. It's not made to be human readable so don't be afraid, you just have to save it on your computer. For that, do a right click, chose \"save as\" and a proper name and location on you computer for this project.\nIf you want to import a previously exported project, you simply have to click on the import section of the file icon.\n\nSearch Poppy blocks\nEvery Poppy block in Snap! begins by a robot icon. So you can search all of them by the robot keyword. To search a specific block, do a right click on the block area, or use the keyboard shortcut CTRL+F.\n\n\n\nNetwork\nFirst test your connection with the (tangible or simulated) robot with the \"test connection\" block.\n.\nif the block answer is \"You may have connection troubles\", your \"host\" variable inside the Snap! project is probably wrong. The host variable must be the IP or the hostname+\".local\" of your robot ; if you're using V-REP localhost is used to point to your own computer.\n.\nBuild your own blocks!\nThe functionality to build your own block was the first difference between Scratch and Snap! (now it's also possible to make custom blocks in Scratch)!\n\nDescription of Poppy blocks\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\nThis block allows you to connect Snap! to your robot. The host input can accept : - robot_name.local (e.g. : poppy.local if your robot’s name is poppy)- the IP address (e.g. 123.124.145.176)\n\n\n\nClick on this block to verify that you are connected to your robot.\n\n\n\nPut one or many motors in compliant or stiff mode. Motors are hand-drivable in compliant mode but must be in stiff mode to controlled with Snap!.The “motor(s)” input can accept:- string of a motor name (e.g. m1)- string of many motors separated with spaces (e.g. m1 m2 m4)- a Snap! list of motors like the reporter block \"$robot all motors\"\" or the block “list”\"\n\n\n\nPut one or many motors in a position (angle in degree) in a given time.The “motor(s)” input can accept: - string of a motor name (e.g. m1) - string of many motors separated with spaces (e.g. m1 m2 m4) - a Snap! list of motors like the reporter block \"$robot all motors\"\" or the block “list”.  “Wait” can be true or false. If it’s on True, the action will wait the end of the previous action. If it’s on False, then the action will proceed during the previous one.\"\n\n\n\nRestart the software inside the robot.\n\n\n\nPut the value to one register (position, speed, max torque, …) of one or many motors.\n\n\n\nActivate/deactivate color leds of motors and choose the color of your choice.The “motor(s)” input can accept: - string of a motor name (e.g. m1) - string of many motors separated with spaces (e.g. m1 m2 m4) - a Snap! list of motors like the reporter block \"$robot all motors\"\" or the block “list”\n\n\n\nPlay a movement at a given speed. It is necessary to indicate the exact name of the movement previously recorded. This block can be nested in the “concurrent/sequential” block.\"\n\n\n\nAll blocks in input are run one after each other.You can use this block to play concurrently many sequently move.\n\n\n\nAll reports input are run simultaneously.You can use this block to play concurrently many recorded move.\n\n\n\nCreate and start a movement recorded by demonstration to the given motors.\n\n\n\nStop a record and save the recorded move in the robot.Be careful, you must have previously defined a move record with the \"create & start record move ...\"\" block.\n\n\n\nStop a movement that is being played.\n\n\n\nPlay movements at the same time (can be nested to concurrent block). Inputs can be : - move name (string) - any reporter block, like sequential or play sequentially\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlay movements following in order (can be nested to sequential block). Inputs can be :  - move name (string) - any reporter block, like sequential or play sequentially\n\n\n\nStart/Stop/Pause/Resume an integrated behaviour of the robot. It can be a position, a movement, a sensorimotor loop, high level camera feature..\n\n\n\nPlay a move in reverse at a given speed  (reporter block)\n\n\n\nPlay a move at a given speed (command block)\n\n\n\nGive motors which are in a given group. You can know groups name with the block “all motors groups”.\n\n\n\nReturn a list with the name of every motors in the robot.\n\n\n\nGive the value of a register (position, speed, load, ... ) of one or many motors.\n\n\n\nGive the position of every motors. It is a shortcut to the block above. It is useful to make a snapshot of pose of the robot.\n\n\n\nReturn the index of a motor name in the \"all motors\" block list.\n\n\n\nGive the URL of the robot. For internal use only.\n\n\n\nGive all records stored in this robot.\n\n\n\nGive the list of all attached/running behaviours .\n\n\n\nGive all existing motors groups.\n\n\n\nGet all methods or functions which are runnable in a behavior.It is an advanced block.\n\n\n\nReturn a boolean (true/false) depending if the selected card is detected by the camera of the robot.\n\n\n\n\n"},"programming/notebooks.html":{"url":"programming/notebooks.html","title":"Usage of Jupyter notebooks","keywords":"","body":"Jupyter Notebooks Gallery: using Python\nMost of the existing examples of using Poppy robots in Python are given as Jupyter Notebooks.

As it is actually the language used for writing Poppy core libraries, you will see how to access all the different levels of control, from the higher to the lower.\nWe will detail everything you need to know to directly program you robot using the Python embedded in the Poppy robot or to install everything locally. Note that this chapter does not intend to teach you Python or programming from scratch and thus if you are completely new to Python it may be good to start with a Python tutorial. Yet, we try to keep the tutorials as simple as possible and we will always warn you when some parts are targeting more advanced users.\nWe will try to provide as many examples as possible and point to the complete API so you can find and use the least famous features. Most of the examples and tutorials are available as a collection of Jupyter notebooks. The next chapter, Jupyter Notebooks Gallery, presents a list describing each notebook, what they will teach, what they can be used for, for which robot, etc.\nAll Poppy libraries are open source and are released under the GPL v3 license. So you can freely access the source code on github. Do not hesitate to fork them, send pull request and contribute!\nWhy Python and Anaconda?\n\nThe libraries developed for the Poppy project were designed with the aim to make it easy and fast to write code for controlling various robots based on - originally - robotis dynamixel motors. The idea was to provide access from the lower level - raw serial communication with a specific motor for instance - to higher levels such as starting and stopping primitives/behaviors (e.g. face tracking, postures, ...) or directly recording motions through learning by demonstration.\nWe decided to write most of them in Python as its flexibility allows for fast and modular development. It was also meant to be accessible by a large audience, from developers and roboticists in general, to hobbyists, researchers, artists... Python was also chosen for the tremendous pools of existing libraries (scientific, computer vision, IO, web...) so if one is interested in adding a new feature, such as support for a new motor/sensor, it should be as easy and fast as possible.\nFinally, support for multiplatforms and ease of installation were also key aspects.\n\nWe also strongly advise to use the Anaconda Python distribution as it already includes most of the libraries needed by the Poppy libraries. We also provide all poppy libraries as conda recipes so they can be easily install using Anaconda (see the install section).\nOverview of the different libraries\n\nInfo A more detailled documentation of these software libraries is available in the software libraries section\n\nBefore jumping into the code, we will briefly introduce the different existing Poppy libraries and how they interact with each other.\nThey are three main library levels:\n\npypot: This is the core of the Poppy software architecture. Pypot handles all the low level communication with the hardware (both sensors and motors), defines synchronization loops so your command are always up to date. It also provides the primitives mechanism which allows the definition of simple behavior that can be - more of less - automatically combined.\n\npoppy-creature: This library defines the common tools shared by all Poppy robots, for instance how to automatically launch the simulator or start the HTTP API attached to any robot.\n\npoppy-ergo-jr, poppy-torso, and poppy-humanoid: Those libraries are specific to their respective Poppy robot. They define the particular configuration of the robot, the sensors it uses, which motors are connected to which buses... This is also were behaviors specific to a creature are defined (the stand primitive for the humanoid for instance).\n\n\nThis is summarized in the diagram below:\n\nInstallation\nFirst, note that if you are only planning to use real robots, they already come with Python and all Poppy libraries installed. You can directly connect to the Jupyter notebook server via the web interface and have nothing to install on your machine!\nWhat you need to install is summarized in the diagram below:\n\nYet, if you are planning to either\n\nUse a simulator (e.g. V-REP, or web simulator),\nor want to directly plug the robot to your computer\n\nYou will have to install Poppy libraries locally. They work on Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, and have been tested on:\n\nPython >= 2.7\nPython >= 3.4\n\nAlso note that if you are planning to directly plug your robot to your USB port, specific drivers should be installed.\nAll steps are detailed in the chapter install Poppy software.\nQuickstart: Hello Poppy world!\nTo give you a rapid overview of what you can do using Python to program Poppy robots, this section will show you how to:\n\nCreate and connect your robot\nRetrieve values from the sensor and send motor commands\nStart playing with primitive by recording motions by demonstration\n\nThis section does not intend to cover everything that can be done in Python with Poppy but to give you sneak peaks of the most common features. For more advanced use, you should refer to the next section where we present a list of Jupyter notebooks each detailing a specific aspect or feature.\nIn the following examples, we assume that you have a working environment meaning that you either:\n\nare using the Python embedded in your robot: through the Jupyter Notebook server,\nor you have installed everything locally to work with a simulator.\n\nCreate and connect to a Poppy robot\nImport the library\nThe very first step you have to do to start programming Poppy robots in Python is to import the library. In Python they are called module or package.\nTo do that, you write something similar to:\nfrom poppy.creatures import *\n\nThis will actually import all Poppy robots installed on the Python distribution you are using. If you want to use a specific robot, you can replace the * (which means all here) by the name of the robot you want.\nFor the ErgoJr:\nfrom poppy.creatures import PoppyErgoJr\n\nFor the Torso:\nfrom poppy.creatures import PoppyTorso\n\nFor the Humanoid:\nfrom poppy.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\n\nNote If you see an error similar to the one below when executing the previous line, this means that the libraries are not correctly installed. See the section install Poppy software.\n\nIn [1]: from poppy.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\nImportError Traceback (most recent call last)\n in ()\n----> 1 from poppy.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\nImportError: cannot import name PoppyHumanoid\n\nCreate the Robot object - with a real robot\nThen, you can actually create the Python object that will represent your robot. Depending on the Poppy robot you are using:\n# if you are using an Ergo Jr\npoppy = PoppyErgoJr()\n\nor\n# if you are using a Torso\npoppy = PoppyTorso()\n\nor\n# if you are using a Humanoid\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid()\n\nAnd that's it, if you did not see any error message it means that you are connected to your robot. If you see an exception like the one shown below, you should check the wire connection and try again:\nIOError: Connection to the robot failed! No suitable port found for ids [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]. These ids are missing [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] !\n\nCreate the Robot object - with V-REP\nTo use a simulated robot instead of a real one, you only have to specify it when creating the Robot object. For instance, if you want to create a simulated Poppy Torso, you simply have to execute the following line:\npoppy = PoppyTorso(simulator='vrep')\n\nAll three Poppy robots - Humanoid, Torso, and Ergo Jr - can be used with V-REP.\nIf you see an error message like this, check that you have launched V-REP and that you have close the popup in V-REP (see this chapter for details).\nIOError: Connection to V-REP failed!\n\nCreate the Robot object - with web simulator\nCurrently only the Ergo Jr is usable within the web simulator.\nIt also requires specific versions of libraries to be used properly.\nTo make sure you meet these requirements, you can type this command from your shell:\npip install pypot>=2.12 poppy-creature>=1.8 poppy-ergo-jr>=1.6 --upgrade\n\nYou can then instantiate the poppy-ergo-jr creature:\npoppy-services --poppy-simu --snap --no-browser poppy-ergo-jr\n\nThis will create a server for Snap! on port 6969, and a server for the visualizer on port 8080.\nYou can then head to the visualizer page.\nAccess the sensors and motors\nThe robot object you just created contains two main groups of objects:\n\nmotors\nsensors\n\nthat can be easily access using poppy.motors and poppy.sensors. As soon as the robot object is created it automatically starts synchronization loops which will ensure that the last available value are received/sent to the robot.\n\nNote  Servomotors that are used in Poppy robots can be seen as both motors and sensors. Indeed, on top of being \"simple\" motors, they also provide multiple sensing information: their current position, speed and load but also their temperature, the current used... Yet, for simplification they are only available under the motor category.\n\nGet data from your robot\n\nNow that you have created your robot object, you can directly use Python to discover which motors are attached.\n\nNote In all examples below the results are shown for an ErgoJr. If you are using a Torso or a Humanoid you will see more motors with different names.\n\nFor instance, to know how many motors your robot have you can execute:\nprint(len(poppy.motors))\n\npoppy.motors is actually a list of all motors connected to your robot. Thus, if you want to get the present position of all motors, you can do:\nfor m in poppy.motors:\n    print(m.present_position)\n\nOf course, you can also access a specific motor. To do that, you need to know the name for the motor you want to access. You can find this list in the assembly documentation of your robot.\nYou can also get a list of all motors name directly from python:\nfor m in poppy.motors:\n    print(m.name)\n\nor using a motor pythonic expression:\nprint([m.name for m in poppy.motors])\n\nThen you can directly access the desired motor by its name:\nm = poppy.m3\n\nor get its position:\nprint(poppy.m3.present_position)\n\nThe most common values for motors are:\n\npresent_position\npresent_speed\npresent_load\n\nSimilarly, you can get data from your sensors. Depending on the Poppy robot you have different sensors available. You can get the list of all sensors in the exact same way you did for motors:\nprint([s.name for s in poppy.sensors])\n\nAnd then access a specific sensors by its name. For instance, to get an image from the camera of the Ergo Jr:\nimg = poppy.camera.frame\n\n\nNote This section just presented some of the available values that you can get from your motors/sensors. They are many other - some are specific to a particular robot - we will present them through the different notebooks.\n\nSend motor commands\nNow that we have shown you how to read values from your robot, it is time to learn how to make it move!\nThis is actually really similar to what you have just seen. Instead of getting the present_position of a motor you simply have to set its goal_position.\nBut first, you have to make sure your motor is stiff, meaning that you cannot move it by hand. To do that we will turn off its compliancy. Assuming you have an Ergo Jr and want to make the motor m3 moves - feel free to use any other motor but make sure the motor can freely move without hurting any of your finger:\npoppy.m3.compliant = False\n\nThe motor should now be stiff. And then, to make it move to its zero position:\npoppy.m3.goal_position = 0\n\n\nNote: present_position and goal_position are actually two different registers. The first refers to the current position of the motor (read only) while the second corresponds to the target position you want your robot to reach. Thus, they can have different values while the motor is still moving to reach its goal_position.\n\nAs a slightly more complex example we will make it go to 30 degrees then -30° three times:\nimport time\n\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = 30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = -30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\nNote that after each new value set to goal_position we wait so the motor has enough time to actually reach this new position. Another way to do the same thing is to use the goto_position method:\nimport time\n\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.m3.goto_position(30, 0.5, wait=True)\n    poppy.m3.goto_position(-30, 0.5, wait=True)\n\nAs you can see, this method takes three arguments, the target position, the duration of the move and whether to wait or not the end of the motion.\nIf you want to move multiple motors at the same time, you can simply do something like:\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.m1.goal_position = -20\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = 30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n    poppy.m1.goal_position = 20\n    poppy.m3.goal_position = -30\n    time.sleep(0.5)\n\nor use a python dictionary storing the target position per motor you want to move, that can be given to the goto_position method:\npos_1 = {'m1': -20, 'm3': 30}\npos_2 = {'m1': 20, 'm3': -30}\n\nfor _ in range(3):\n    poppy.goto_position(pos_1, 0.5, wait=True)\n    poppy.goto_position(pos_2, 0.5, wait=True)\n\n\nNote You can turn a motor back to its compliant mode (where you can freely move it) by setting its compliant register to True:\npoppy.m3.compliant = True\n\n\nRecord and play motion by demonstration using primitives\nPypot provides you with the primitive mechanism, which are simply pre-defined behaviors that can be attached to your robot. In this section, we will show you how to use some primitives already existing for recording and playing motions. You can also define your own primitive but this is out of the scope of this section, you will find details on how to do this in dedicated notebooks.\nRecord a motion by demonstration\nDesigning choreographies for your robot using goal_position or goto_position can be long and kind of troublesome. Fortunately, there is a much more efficient way of doing this: recording motions by directly demonstrating the move on the robot.\nThis can be summarized into few steps:\n\nmake the robot compliant so you can move it by hand\nstart the recording\nactually moves the robot so it follows whatever move/choreography you can think of\nstop the recording\n\nAnd now to do that in Python:\nSo, first we turn all motors of the robot compliants:\nfor m in poppy.motors:\n    m.compliant = True\n\n\nInfo You can also record a movement with motors stiff (compliant = False), and moving them with goal_position or goto_position commands.\n\nThen, we have to include the primitive used for recording motion:\nfrom pypot.primitive.move import MoveRecorder\n\nTo create this primitive, you have to give the following arguments:\n\non which robot you want to use this primitive (this can be useful if you are working with multiple robot at a time - for instance you can record a move on a robot and at the same time make it reproduce by another one. \nthe record frequency of the move you want to register: how many position per second will be recorded - the higher the more accurate the record will be but also more data will have to be processed - good values are usually between 10Hz and 50Hz.\nthe motors that you want to record. you can record a move on a subpart of you robot, for instance only on the left arm.\n\nHere, we will record a move on the whole robot at 50Hz:\nrecorder = MoveRecorder(poppy, 50, poppy.motors)\n\n\nNote We used poppy.motors to specify that we want all motors if you only want let's say the two first motors of an Ergo Jr you could have used [poppy.m1, poppy.m2] instead.\n\nNow it is time to record. As it can be hard to both move the robot and type Python command at the same time, we will make a small script, that:\n\nwait 5s so you can get ready to record\nstart the record\nrecord for 10 seconds\nstop the records\n\nimport time\n\n# Give you time to get ready\nprint('Get ready to record a move...')\ntime.sleep(5)\n\n# Start the record\nrecord.start()\nprint('Now recording !')\n\n# Wait for 10s so you can record what you want\ntime.sleep(10)\n\n# Stop the record\nprint('The record is over!')\nrecord.stop()\n\nNow, you should have a move recorded. You can retrieve it from the recorder primitive:\nmy_recorded_move = record.move\n\nand check how many positions where recorded:\nprint(len(my_recorded_move.positions()))\n\nReplay recorded moves\nNow to play back recorded motions you have to use another primitive: MovePlayer\nfrom pypot.primitive.move import MovePlayer\n\nplayer = MovePlayer(poppy, my_recorded_move)\n\nAs you can see, to create it you have to specify the robot (as for the MoveRecorder) and the move you want to play.\n\nNote Automatically all recorded motors become stiff to be able to play the move.\n\nThen, you can simply start the replay:\nplayer.start()\n\nAnd if you want to play it three times in a row:\nfor _ in range(3):\n    player.start()\n    player.wait_to_stop()\n\nWe use the wait_to_stop method to make sure we wait for the first move to finish before we start another. By default, playing a move we will not block to allow you to play multiple move in parallel.\nWrite a simple sensori-motor loop\nRobotic is all about sensori-motor loops, meaning that motor commands will be more or less directly related to the sensor readings. In other terms the robot actions will be determined by what it perceives from its environment.\nPoppy libraries and more particularly pypot provides you with tools to easily write sensori-motor loops. We will show here a very simple example where some motor of an Ergo Jr will be controlled by the position of other motors in order to keep the head of the Ergo Jr straight.\nTo do that, we will free the two first motors, so they can be moved by hand. Two other motors will try to lively compensate the motion applied on the free motors.\nWe need few simple steps:\n\nread values from sensors (here the two free motors)\ncompute command from those readings\nset new motor command\ngo back to step 1.\n\n\nNote This example is designed for the Ergo Jr. It could be adapted to other Poppy robots, by changing the motors used. Yet, it is not that obvious which one to use to have a \"cool\" result.\n\nDemo version\nBefore writing the sensori-motor loop, we will first set the Ergo Jr in a base position.\nfrom poppy.creatures import PoppyErgoJr\n\njr = PoppyErgoJr()\n\njr.goto_position({'m1': 0.,\n                  'm2': -60.,\n                  'm3': 55.,\n                  'm4': 0.,\n                  'm5': -55.,\n                  'm6': 60.}, 2., wait=True)\n\nThen, we make sure the moving speed of the motors are not too high to prevent shaky motions:\nfor m in jr.motors:\n    m.moving_speed = 250\n\nFinally, we free the two first motors:\njr.m1.compliant = True\njr.m2.compliant = True\n\nNow, that everything is setup we write our very simple sensori-motor loop like this:\nimport time\n\nwhile True:\n    # Step 1\n    p1 = jr.m1.present_position\n    p2 = jr.m2.present_position\n\n    # Step 2\n    g1 = -p1\n    g2 = -p2\n\n    # Step 3\n    jr.m4.goal_position = g1\n    jr.m6.goal_position = g2\n\n    time.sleep(.02)\n\n\nStep 1: As you can see, here our readings step is simply to retrieve the present_position of the motors m1 and m2.\nStep 2: Here, we defined the base position so the motors m1/m4 and m2/m6 are parallel. Thus, to compensate the head position, we simply have to define the new motor goal position as the opposite of the read present position.\nStep 3: We simply set the goal position as the just computed command\n\nThose steps are included inside an infinite loop - with a time.sleep to avoid CPU overhead.\n\nNote To stop this while True loop, you will have to use the classical Ctrl-c, or use the stop button if you are running it through Jupyter.\n\nNow with a primitive\nBut what about if you want to make this behavior an independent \"brick\" that you can start/stop on demand combine with other behaviors. Well, primitives are meant to do just that.\nThere is two main types of primitive: Primitive and LoopPrimitive. The first one basically gives you access to just a run method where you can do everything you want on a robot. The second one as the name indicates is an infinite loop which calls an update method at a pre-defined frequency. In our case it is the more suited one.\nHere is the entire definition of this primitive:\nclass KeepYourHeadStraight(LoopPrimitive):\n    def setup(self):\n        for m in self.robot.motors:\n            m.compliant = False\n\n        self.robot.goto_position({'m1': 0.,\n                                  'm2': -60.,\n                                  'm3': 55.,\n                                  'm4': 0.,\n                                  'm5': -55.,\n                                  'm6': 60.}, 2., wait=True)\n\n        for m in self.robot.motors:\n            m.moving_speed = 250\n\n        self.robot.m1.compliant = True\n        self.robot.m2.compliant = True\n\n    def update(self):\n        self.robot.m4.goal_position = -self.robot.m1.present_position\n        self.robot.m6.goal_position = -self.robot.m2.present_position\n\nAs you can see, there is two main parts. The setup method which defines what needs to be done to prepare the robot before starting the behavior - here simply puts it in its base position and turn on the compliance for the two first motors.\nAnd the update method which will be regularly called: here is where we put the actual code for the sensori-motor loop: reading sensor - computing the new command - and sending the new command to the motors.\nNow that we have defined our primitive, we can instantiate it and start it:\n# we specify we want the primitive to apply on the jr robot instance\n# and that the update method should be called at 50Hz\nhead_straight = KeepYourHeadStraight(jr, 50.0)\n\nhead_straight.start()\n\nYou can stop it whenever you want:\nhead_straight.stop()\n\nAnd re-starting it again...\nhead_straight.start()\n\nThe huge advantage of using a primitive in this case is that after starting it, you can still easily run any other codes that you want. The primitive starts its own thread and thus runs in background without blocking the execution of the rest of the code.\n"},"programming/rest.html":{"url":"programming/rest.html","title":"Robots APIs","keywords":"","body":"Use the REST API to control a Poppy Robot\n\nCaution This page is not currently written.

When working with a real robot you can program it from a web browser on your own machine but your notebooks are actually stored and run in the robot.\nThus to switch from simulation to a real robot, you need to switch from your local instance of Jupyter to the remote one hosted by the robot. The steps are described below.\nConnect to the Jupyter on the robot\nOnce connected to the robot web interface http://poppy.local (we will assume here its hostname is poppy, just replace it by the new hostname if you changed it), you should see a open Ipython notebook link.\n\nWhen clicked it will start Jupyter on the robot and redirect you to the Jupyter webserver. You should then see the root of the notebook folder hosted on the robot:\n\nThis is where you can put your own notebooks. Of course, you can create folder, organize them as you want, etc...\nNote: If you need finer access or more advanced configuration (such as permission for instance), you have to log directly to the robot using ssh.\nUpload a notebook\nOnce connected to the Jupyter server hosted by the robot, you can directly use the Jupyter interface for uploading new notebooks.\n\nThe circled button let you upload your local notebook, so stored on your own machine, to the robot. They can then be directly run on the robot.\nBe aware that at the moment, we do not deal with sessions or permissions (as JupyterHub does for instance), and thus anyone with access to the robot can use or delete all notebooks stored in the robot.\nAdapt your code\nThere is few places where you should actually modify your code so it works with a real robot. We try to minimize the effort needed as much as possible, yet some steps are still required.\nInstantiation\nWhen creating the robot, you actually need to specify if you are willing to work with a real or a simulated robot. This is simply done via a parameter. For instance:\nWhen working with V-REP:\nfrom poppy.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid(simulator='vrep')\n\nWill become for a real robot:\nfrom poppy.creatures import PoppyHumanoid\n\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid()\n\nOf course, this works for all existing Poppy creatures: Humanoid, Torso and ErgoJr.\nThis is most of the changes that you should do.\nSpecific APIs\nSome part of the API are platform specific. For instance, when using V-REP you have access to tracking features that let you retrieve any object 3D position. Of course, such method do not have a real world equivalent and thus are not available when working with a real robot.\nA good practice if you want to write code compatible for both cases is to use the simulated property. It is automatically set to the correct value depending on how your instantiate your robot. For instance,\npoppy = PoppyHumanoid(simulator='vrep')\n\ndef reset_position():\n    if poppy.simulated:\n        poppy.reset_simulation()\n    else:\n        print('Ask one internship student to put the robot back in its origin position.')\n        time.sleep(10)\n\nVersion and 3rd party libraries\nThe main drawback of this client/server way of working is that your locally installed software versions may differ from the one installed on the robot.\nThe Python installed on the robot is Python 2.7 and comes with most of the scientific main libraries (numpy, scipy, matplotlib, opencv). An exhaustive list of the installed Python packages will be available soon . At the moment, the easier way to get it is to used a terminal notebook which can be directly run from the Jupyter interface.\n\n\nUsing the same technique, you can install 3rd party libraries directly on the robot. The pip and conda utility tools are installed and should be used when possible.\nNote that the embedded board are based on armv7 and thus some libraries may be hard to compile. We are maintaining a list of conda recipes specifically built for this platform here.Contributions are more than welcomed! \n"},"software-libraries/":{"url":"software-libraries/","title":"Software libraries","keywords":"","body":"Software libraries\nThis section will provide software documentation of various libraries used in Poppy robots.\n\nPypot\nPoppy-creature\nPoppy Ergo Jr\nPoppy Humanoid\nPoppy Torso \n\n"},"software-libraries/pypot.html":{"url":"software-libraries/pypot.html","title":"Pypot","keywords":"","body":"Pypot library\n\n\nCaution Pypot documentation has still not been merged in the new documentation.

It links high level controls and pypot, the generic low level library.\nIt mainly contains the class definition of poppy.creatures.abstractcreature.AbstractPoppyCreature which takes a configuration and builds a pypot.robot.robot.Robot out of it, but also a bunch of parameters to launch Snap! or HTTP servers, or to replace the communication toward Dynamixel servos by a communication with a simulator.\nThe arguments you can provide are:\n\nbase_path default: None Path where the creature sources are. The\nlibrarie looks in the default PATH if not set.\nconfig default: None Path to the configuration file with respect\nto the base-path\nsimulator default: None Possible values : 'vrep' or 'poppy-simu'.\nDefines if we are using a simulator (and which one) or a real robot.\nscene default: None Path to the scene to load in the simulator.\nOnly if simulator is vrep.

It provides shortcuts to start services like SnapRemoteServer and HTTPRemoteServer from your terminal.\nExample:\n    poppy-services poppy-ergo-jr --snap --no-browser\nThis will launch the SnapRemoteServer for a real Poppy Ergo Jr robot.\n\nNote The --no-browser option avoid the automatic redirection to the Snap! webpage.\nYou can remove it if you use a computer with a GUI (e.g your laptop instead of the robot embedded board).\n\nAnother example:\n    poppy-services poppy-ergo-jr --snap --poppy-simu\nIt will open a Snap! windows for a simulated poppy-ergo-jr.\nThe way to use it is:\npoppy-services  \nthe available options are:\n\n--vrep: creates the specified creature for using with V-REP simulator\n--poppy-simu: creates the specified creature for using with web simulator and also launches the HTTP server needed by poppy-simu.
